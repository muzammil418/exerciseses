### 🚀 Kepler-186f Path Finder Challenge **  
**Story**  
After analyzing the probe’s data, you discover a sequence of movements it used to traverse the surface of **Kepler-186f**, a potentially habitable exoplanet. The probe sent a string of navigation commands (e.g., `"F2R1B3"` where `F`=forward, `R`=right, `B`=backward, `L`=left) and recorded its final coordinates. Your task is to simulate the probe’s path, calculate its final position, and determine if it reached a designated **mineral-rich zone** at coordinates `(8, -4)`.

---

### 🛠️ **The Problem**  
Write a C program that:  
1. Takes a string of commands (e.g., `"F2R1B3"`) where:  
   - `F` = move forward (y+number)  
   - `B` = move backward (y-number)  
   - `R` = move right (x+number)  
   - `L` = move left (x-number)  
2. Starts at coordinates `(0, 0)`  
3. Processes the string **two characters at a time** (first the direction, then the number)  
4. Outputs:  
   - `"Minerals found!"` if final coordinates match `(8, -4)`  
   - `"Probe lost. Analyze path again!"` otherwise  

**Example Input**:  
```c  
"R2F3B1L4"  // R2 → x=2, F3 → y=3, B1 → y=2, L4 → x=-2  
```  
**Example Output**:  
```c  
Final coordinates: (-2, 2)  
Probe lost. Analyze path again!  
```

### 💡 Hints  
1. Use a loop to process the string in **pairs** (e.g., `command[i]` for direction, `command[i+1]` for magnitude).  
2. Convert the second character (`'3'` → `3`) using `command[i+1] - '0'`.  
3. Track `x` and `y` as integers, updating them based on the direction.
