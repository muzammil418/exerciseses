## The Stellar Cartographer's Challenge

The year is 2347. You are Muz, a junior cartographer aboard the starship *Aurora*. Your job is to map newly discovered planetary systems for potential colonization. Captain Eva has just received data from a long-range probe exploring the Kepler-186 system – a promising candidate! However, the probe's sensor array malfunctioned during its final scan of the primary planet, Kepler-186f.

The probe managed to record temperature readings at various points across the planet’s surface, but the data is jumbled and incomplete. You need to process this raw data to determine if Kepler-186f has regions suitable for human life (temperatures between 10°C and 30°C).

**The Data:**

The probe recorded temperature readings in a single array called `temperatureReadings`. This array contains the temperatures (in Celsius) at different locations on Kepler-186f.  Unfortunately, some values are missing (-999 indicates a faulty reading).

Here's an example of what the data might look like:

`temperatureReadings = {25, -999, 18, 32, 12, -999, 28, 15}`

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that does the following:

1.  Takes an array of integer temperature readings as input (you can hardcode this into your program for now – don't worry about user input yet).
2.  Iterates through the `temperatureReadings` array using a loop.
3.  For each reading, check if it’s a valid temperature (not -999).
4.  If the temperature is valid *and* falls within the habitable range (10°C to 30°C inclusive), increment a counter called `habitableCount`.
5.  After processing all readings, print the final value of `habitableCount` – this represents the number of locations on Kepler-186f that are potentially habitable.

**Example:**

For the example data above (`temperatureReadings = {25, -999, 18, 32, 12, -999, 28, 15}`), your program should output: `4` (because 25, 18, 12, and 28 are valid and within the range).

**Hints:**

*   Remember to initialize `habitableCount` to 0 before you start looping.
*   Use an `if` statement inside your loop to check for both invalid readings (-999) *and* the temperature range.
*   The `inclusive` means that 10 and 30 are also considered habitable temperatures.

Next, try adding a feature to calculate and print the average temperature of all valid readings on Kepler-186f.  You’ll need another variable to keep track of the sum of the valid temperatures.

**C Code Skeleton (to get them started):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int temperatureReadings[] = {25, -999, 18, 32, 12, -999, 28, 15}; // Example data
    int numReadings = sizeof(temperatureReadings) / sizeof(temperatureReadings[0]);  // Calculate the number of elements in the array
    int habitableCount = 0;
    // int sumOfTemperatures = 0; // For the average calculation

    // Your code here to iterate through the array and count habitable locations

    printf("Number of potentially habitable locations: %d\n", habitableCount);
    // printf("Average temperature of valid readings: %.2f\n", (double)sumOfTemperatures / numValidReadings); // For the optional challenge

    return 0;
}
```

**Glossary:**

*   **Cartographer:** A person who draws maps.
*   **Sensor Array:**  A collection of devices that measure things like temperature, pressure, or light. Think of it as a group of tiny measuring tools all working together.
*   **Malfunction:** To stop working properly.
*   **Habitable:** Suitable for living in; able to support life.
*   **Inclusive:** Including both ends of a range (e.g., 10-30 inclusive means it includes 10 and 30).
*   **Iterate:**  To go through each item in a list or array, one by one.
