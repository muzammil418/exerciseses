## The Alien Message Decoder

**Story:**

The *Aurora* has intercepted a strange signal from Kepler-186f! It appears to be a coded message from an alien civilization. Fortunately, you’ve discovered that the aliens use a simple substitution cipher – each letter in their alphabet is replaced by another letter.

You've managed to partially decode the message and know that the alien word for "hello" is represented as "khoor". You suspect that this pattern holds true for other words in the message. Your task is to help decipher a short phrase sent by the aliens.

**The Data:**

The intercepted phrase is stored in a string called `alienPhrase`.  For example:

`alienPhrase = "khoor#kxpdq$#krz#duh#|rx#grlqj#wrgd|B"`

You know that “hello” translates to “khoor”.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that does the following:

1. Takes the `alienPhrase` string as input (you can hardcode it into your program for now).
2. Iterates through each character in the `alienPhrase` string using a loop.
3. Print the modified phrase after deciphering all the characters in the string.

**Example:**

For the example data above (`alienPhrase = "khoor#kxpdq$#krz#duh#|rx#grlqj#wrgd|B"`), your program should output: `"hello human! how are you doing today?"`.

**Hints:**

*   Remember that strings in C are arrays of characters.
*   You'll need to use the `strlen()` function (from `<string.h>`) to find the length of the string and control your loop.
*   Be careful about modifying the string directly within the loop – you might want to build a new string instead.

**C Code Skeleton:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char alienPhrase[] = "khoor#kxpdq$#krz#duh#|rx#grlqj#wrgd|B"; // Example data
    int phraseLength = strlen(alienPhrase); // msg length is 37 characters
    char decodedPhrase[38]; // Allocate space for the new string (+1 for null character)

    // Your code here to iterate through the alienPhrase and replace 'j' with 'h'

    printf("Decoded phrase: %s\n", decodedPhrase);

    return 0;
}
```

**Glossary:**

*   **Cipher:** A method of encrypting or decoding messages.
*   **Substitution Cipher:**  A simple type of cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter or symbol.
*   **Intercepted:** To overhear or catch a communication that wasn't meant for you.
*   **Null Terminator:** A special character ('\0') at the end of every C string, which marks the end of the string.
*   **strlen():** A function from the `<string.h>` library that returns the length of a string (excluding the null terminator).
