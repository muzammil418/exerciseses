## The Lost Caravan of Eldoria: Analyzing the Damage

**Story:**

Following the blizzard that scattered the caravan, you, Elara the apprentice cartographer, have been tasked with not only recovering the moonstones but also assessing the damage to the wagons. Each wagon has a different number of broken wheels, ranging from 0 to 4 (since the roads were rough even before the storm). The King needs to know how many wagons suffered significant damage – those with 3 or more broken wheels.

**The Challenge:**

You have been given a list of numbers representing the number of broken wheels on *ten* different wagons. Your task is to write a C program that:

1.  Stores these ten numbers in an **array**.
2.  Uses a **loop** to go through each wagon’s wheel count in the array.
3.  For each wagon, check if the number of broken wheels is 3 or more.
4.  Keeps track of how many wagons have 3 or more broken wheels.
5.  Finally, displays the total number of "significantly damaged" wagons.

**The Wagon Wheel Readings (Broken Wheel Counts):**

Wagon 1: 1
Wagon 2: 0
Wagon 3: 4
Wagon 4: 2
Wagon 5: 3
Wagon 6: 1
Wagon 7: 0
Wagon 8: 4
Wagon 9: 2
Wagon 10: 3

**Example Output:**

```
Number of significantly damaged wagons: 4
```

**Hints:**

*   Remember to declare an array capable of holding 10 integers.
*   Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array, checking each element individually.
*   Use an `if` statement inside the loop to check if the number of broken wheels is greater than or equal to 3.
*   Increment (increase by one) a counter variable whenever you find a significantly damaged wagon.
*   Print the final count of significantly damaged wagons after the loop finishes.

**C Program Structure (Skeleton Code - you need to fill in the blanks):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Declare an array to store the broken wheel counts
  int wagon_wheels[10];

  // TODO: Initialize the array with the values from the readings

  // TODO: Calculate the number of significantly damaged wagons using a loop

  // Print the total number of significantly damaged wagons
  printf("Number of significantly damaged wagons: %d\n", damaged_wagons);

  return 0;
}
```

| Word        | Meaning                                  | Example Sentence                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assess**    | To evaluate or judge the value/condition of something. | Elara needs to assess the damage to the wagons.  |
| **Significant** | Important; noteworthy                   | Wagons with 3 or more broken wheels are significantly damaged.|
| **Increment** | To increase by a small amount            | We increment the counter when we find damaged wagon. |
| **Counter**   | A variable used to keep track of something.  | The `damaged_wagons` variable is a counter.         |
| **Rough**      | Uneven or difficult to traverse        | The roads were rough, causing damage to the wagons.|
