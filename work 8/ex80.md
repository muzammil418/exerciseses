**Mini Project: "The School Cafeteria Food Tracker"**  

**Story:**  
You are helping the school cafeteria manager track food items and their stock. The cafeteria has 5 popular food items, and you need to create a system to:  
1. Display all food items and their current stock.  
2. Allow students to **order** food (subtract from stock).  
3. Allow the manager to **restock** items (add to stock).  
4. Prevent students from ordering food that is out of stock.

### **Your Tasks**  
1. **Use arrays** to store food item names and their stock.  
2. **Use loops** to let the user choose actions (menu) and process orders.  
3. **Use if conditions** to validate choices (e.g., checking stock before an order).

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**  
#### **1. Define the Food Data**  
- Create a 2D array for food names and an array for their stock:  
  ```c  
  char foods[5][30] = {  
      "Pasta", "Burger", "Salad", "Pizza", "Fruit Juice"  
  };  
  int stock[5] = {10, 15, 8, 12, 20};  // Initial stock count  
  ```  

#### **2. Create the Menu Loop**  
- Use a `do-while` loop to display the menu and process actions:  
  ```  
  1. Display all food items and stock  
  2. Order food  
  3. Restock food  
  4. Exit  
  ```  
  
You can learn the do-white loop syntax from: https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_do_while_loop.php

#### **3. Display Food Stock**  
- Loop through the `foods` and `stock` arrays to print:  
  ```  
  Pasta: 10 in stock  
  Burger: 15 in stock  
  ...  
  ```  

#### **4. Handle Food Orders**  
- Ask the user to choose a food item (1-5) and the quantity.  
- Check if the stock is sufficient.  
- Subtract the quantity from stock if available.  
- Print error messages if the stock is too low.  

#### **5. Handle Restocking**  
- Ask the user to choose a food item (1-5) and the amount to add.  
- Add the amount to the stock.  

#### **6. Exit the Program**  
- Break the loop when the user chooses option 4.

### **Sample Code Skeleton**  
```c  
#include <stdio.h>  

#define NUM_FOODS 5  

int main() {  
    char foods[NUM_FOODS][30] = {"Pasta", "Burger", "Salad", "Pizza", "Fruit Juice"};  
    int stock[NUM_FOODS] = {10, 15, 8, 12, 20};  

    int choice;
	
	// TODO: Project code goes here

    return 0;  
}  
```
