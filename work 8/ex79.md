**Problem Title: "The Garden Growth Tracker"**  

**Story:**  
You are helping your neighbor, Mrs. Green, track the growth of her garden. She has 3 types of plants (A, B, C), and each day she measures how much each plant grows in centimeters. She records these measurements in a table. Your task is to calculate the **total growth** for each plant over 4 days.  

**Your Goal:**  
Use a 2D array to store the growth data and loops to calculate the total growth for each plant.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**  
1. **Create a 2D array** with 3 rows (plants) and 4 columns (days). Example data:  
   ```c  
   int growth[3][4] = {
       {1, 2, 3, 4},  // Plant A
       {2, 3, 1, 5},  // Plant B
       {4, 0, 2, 3}   // Plant C
   };
   ```  
   *Each number represents growth in centimeters for a day.*  

2. **Use nested loops** to:  
   - Iterate through each plant (row).  
   - For each plant, add up the growth values (sum the columns).  

3. **Print the total growth** for each plant in this format:  
   ```  
   Plant A total growth: 10 cm  
   Plant B total growth: 11 cm  
   Plant C total growth: 9 cm  
   ```

### **Sample Code Skeleton**  
```c  
#include <stdio.h>  

int main() {  
    // Create the growth array & initialize it
	
	// Code to calculate the total growth per plant

    return 0;  
}  
```
