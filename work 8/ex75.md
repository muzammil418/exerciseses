## 🏰 **The Castle’s Secret Staircase**

### 1️⃣ The Story

In the kingdom of **Algoria**, a brave knight named **Liam** has to climb a mysterious castle staircase.  
The stairs are special: each step is numbered, and some steps have hidden traps that must be avoided.

Your job is to help Liam count how many safe steps he can take before reaching the top of the tower.

### 2️⃣ Problem Description

- The castle has **N** steps (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).  
- Some steps are *trap steps* – you cannot stand on them.  
- You will be given a list of the trap step numbers.  
- Liam starts at step 0 (the ground) and can only move **one step up at a time**.  
- If he lands on a trap step, he must stop immediately – that path is not safe.  
- Count how many *consecutive* safe steps Liam can take before hitting the first trap or reaching the top.

### 3️⃣ Input

1. An integer `N` – total number of steps.  
2. An integer `T` – number of trap steps (0 ≤ T < N).  
3. `T` integers, each a distinct trap step number (between 1 and N).

**Example**

```
10
3
3 7 9
```

### 4️⃣ Output

A single integer: the number of safe consecutive steps from the ground.

For the example above, the answer is **2** because Liam can safely climb to step 2, but step 3 is a trap.

### 5️⃣ How to Solve (in plain English)

1. Read `N` and `T`.  
2. Put all trap numbers into an array or list.  
3. Start from step 0 and increase the step number one by one.  
4. At each new step, check if it is in the trap list.  
   - If it **is** a trap → stop counting.  
   - If it **is not** a trap → continue.  
5. When you stop, print how many steps you counted.

### 6️⃣ Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Array** | A collection of items stored in consecutive memory locations; we’ll use it to hold the trap numbers. |
| **Loop (for / while)** | Repeats a block of code until a condition is met; used to step through each stair. |

### 7️⃣ Skeleton Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_STEPS 100   // enough for this problem

int main(void) {
    int N, T;
    scanf("%d %d", &N, &T);

    int traps[MAX_STEPS];
    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i)
        scanf("%d", &traps[i]);

    /* TODO: Count safe steps */
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 8️⃣ Hints

- Use a `for` loop that runs from `step = 1` to `N`.  
- Inside the loop, use another loop (or a function) to see if `step` matches any value in `traps[]`.  
- If you find a match, break out of the outer loop.  
- Keep a counter that starts at 0 and increases each time you land on a safe step.

Good luck, Knight Liam! 🚀
