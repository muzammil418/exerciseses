### 🌟 **Story: The Library of Time**  
In a quiet town lives **Leo**, a curious librarian who manages a magical library. Every book in the library is stamped with a **time code** (a number from 1 to 5, representing different centuries: 1=1500s, 2=1600s, ..., 5=1900s). Leo needs to **organize books by their time code** to preserve their magic.  

Your task: Write a program to **count how many books belong to each century**.

---

### 🧩 **Problem Statement**  
Write a C program that:  
1. Takes **10 time codes** as input (integers from 1 to 5).  
2. Counts how many books are in each century.  
3. Prints the result like:  
   ```  
   Century 1: X books  
   Century 2: Y books  
   ...  
   ```  

**Rules**:  
- Use an array to store counts (e.g., `int counts[5]`).  
- Validate inputs (if user enters invalid numbers, ignore them).

|------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| **Century** | A period of 100 years (e.g., 1500s = 1500–1599)|  
| **Code**    | A short number or symbol representing a category |

### ✅ **Sample Input/Output**  
**Input**:  
```  
1  
2  
3  
1  
4  
5  
1  
2  
2  
3  
```  

**Output**:  
```  
Century 1: 3 books  
Century 2: 3 books  
Century 3: 2 books  
Century 4: 1 book  
Century 5: 1 book  
```

### 🛠️ **Hints**  
- Use a loop to read 10 inputs.  
- For each input, increment `counts[input-1]` (since arrays start at index 0).  
- After reading inputs, print each count.
