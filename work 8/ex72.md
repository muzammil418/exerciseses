## The Kepler-186f Terrain Analysis

Following your initial assessment of Kepler-186f, Captain Eva has decided that further investigation is needed. You've been tasked with analyzing a more detailed scan of the planet’s surface – this time focusing on elevation data.  The probe managed to map several regions, and each region is represented by a grid of elevation readings.

**The Data:**

The probe recorded elevation data in two arrays:

*   `regionCount`: This 1D array stores the number of regions scanned. For example, `regionCount = {3}` means that three different regions were scanned.
*   `elevationGrid`: This is a 2D array (an array of arrays) where each inner array represents a region's elevation grid. Each element in the inner array represents the elevation (in meters) at a specific point within that region.

Here’s an example:

```
regionCount = {2}; // Two regions scanned

elevationGrid[0] = {  // Region 1
    {10, 15, 20},
    {12, 18, 22},
    {14, 20, 25}
};

elevationGrid[1] = {  // Region 2
    {5, 8, 11},
    {7, 10, 13},
    {9, 12, 15}
};
```

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that does the following:

1.  Takes the `regionCount` and `elevationGrid` arrays as input (you can hardcode these into your program for now).
2.  Uses an outer loop to iterate through each region in the `regionCount` array.
3.  For *each* region, use a nested inner loop to iterate through all the elevation readings within that region's grid.
4.  For each elevation reading, check if it’s greater than 1000 meters. If it is, increment a counter called `highElevationCount`.
5.  After processing all regions and all their elevation readings, print the final value of `highElevationCount` – this represents the number of locations on Kepler-186f with high elevations.

**Example:**

Using the example data above, your program should output: `0` (because none of the elevation readings are greater than 1000 meters).

**Hints:**

*   Remember to initialize `highElevationCount` to 0 before you start looping.
*   The outer loop will iterate based on the values in the `regionCount` array.
*   The inner loop will iterate through the rows and columns of each region's elevation grid.  You’ll need to know the dimensions (rows and columns) of each region's grid. You can assume all regions are square grids (same number of rows and columns).

Next, calculate the average elevation for *each* region and print it after processing each region.

**C Code Skeleton:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int regionCount[] = {2}; // Example data: 2 regions scanned
    int elevationGrid[2][3] = {  // Example elevation grid (2 regions, each 3x3)
        {10, 15, 20},
        {12, 18, 22},
        {14, 20, 25}
    };

    int elevationGrid2[2][3] = {  // Example elevation grid (2 regions, each 3x3)
        {5, 8, 11},
        {7, 10, 13},
        {9, 12, 15}
    };

    int highElevationCount = 0;

    // Your code here to iterate through regions and elevation readings
	
	// Code to print the average elevation of the region
	
    printf("Number of locations with high elevations: %d\n", highElevationCount);

    return 0;
}
```

**Glossary:**

*   **Elevation:** The height of a point above sea level.
*   **Grid:** A regular pattern of rows and columns, like a chessboard or graph paper.
*   **Nested Loop:**  A loop placed inside another loop. This is useful for processing data in a two-dimensional structure (like a grid).
*   **2D Array:** An array that has multiple dimensions. Think of it as an array of arrays – like rows and columns.
