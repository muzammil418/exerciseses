## The Mariner’s Market Inventory

**Story:**

The Mariner’s Market is a vibrant hub in the coastal city of Port Azure. Merchants from across the seas gather here to sell their wares. You are assisting Elara, your cartographer aunt who now manages the market's inventory! She needs help keeping track of how many units of each item are currently available at different stalls.

Each stall specializes in a particular type of good: Fish, Spices, Textiles, and Pottery. The market has 3 rows of stalls, and each row has 4 stalls. Elara uses a simple grid to record the number of items at each stall.

**The Challenge:**

You have been given a 2D array representing the market inventory. Each element in the array represents the quantity of goods at a specific stall. Your task is to write a C program that:

1.  Stores this data in a 2D array (3 rows x 4 columns).
2.  Uses nested **loops** – one loop for the rows and another loop for the columns – to iterate through each element of the array.
3.  Calculates the *total* number of Fish available across all stalls. The first column represents Fish, the second Spices, the third Textiles, and the fourth Pottery.
4.  Displays the total quantity of Fish found in the market.

**The Market Inventory (Quantities):**

```
Fish  Spices Textiles Pottery
-----------------------------
 15    8       22      5
 7     10      3       12
 9     5       18      7
```

This translates to a 2D array like this:

```
[ [15, 8, 22, 5],   // Row 1
  [7, 10, 3, 12],   // Row 2
  [9, 5, 18, 7]    // Row 3
]
```

**Example Output:**

```
Total Fish Available: 31
```

**Hints:**

*   Declare a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns of integers.
*   Use an outer `for` loop to iterate through the rows (from 0 to 2).
*   Use an inner `for` loop within the outer loop to iterate through the columns (from 0 to 3) for each row.
*   To access the quantity of Fish, remember that it's always in the *first column* (index 0) of each stall. Add this value to a running total.
*   Print the final total using `printf`.

**C Program Structure (Skeleton Code - you need to fill in the blanks):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Declare a 2D array to store the market inventory
  int market_inventory[3][4];

  // Initialize the array with the given quantities
  market_inventory[0][0] = 15; // Fish in Row 1, Stall 1
  market_inventory[0][1] = 8;  // Spices in Row 1, Stall 2
  market_inventory[0][2] = 22; // Textiles in Row 1, Stall 3
  market_inventory[0][3] = 5;  // Pottery in Row 1, Stall 4

  market_inventory[1][0] = 7;  // Fish in Row 2, Stall 1
  market_inventory[1][1] = 10; // Spices in Row 2, Stall 2
  market_inventory[1][2] = 3;  // Textiles in Row 2, Stall 3
  market_inventory[1][3] = 12; // Pottery in Row 2, Stall 4

  market_inventory[2][0] = 9;  // Fish in Row 3, Stall 1
  market_inventory[2][1] = 5;  // Spices in Row 3, Stall 2
  market_inventory[2][2] = 18; // Textiles in Row 3, Stall 3
  market_inventory[2][3] = 7;  // Pottery in Row 3, Stall 4

  // TODO: Calculate the total number of Fish using nested loops

  // Print the total number of Fish
  printf("Total Fish Available: %d\n", total_fish);

  return 0;
}
```
