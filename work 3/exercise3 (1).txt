=========================
0. Read all the rules below
1. The output on cmd must match the Expected Output exactly.
2. All programs should start with a comment of program description.
3. The final source code (C files) should be submitted by email.

----------------------------------------------------------

21. Update the program in exercise 4 to use functions. Following two function(s) need to be implemented:

rectArea -- returns the area of a rectangle
rectPerimeter -- returns the perimeter of a rectangle

----------------------------------------------------------

22. Update the program in exercise 5 to use functions. Following two function(s) need to be implemented:

circleArea -- returns the area of a circle
circlePerimeter -- returns the perimeter of a circle

----------------------------------------------------------

23. Update the program in exercise 8 to use functions. Following two function(s) need to be implemented:

calc -- Takes two real numbers and a char (for maths operator) as input and returns the result of the calculation

----------------------------------------------------------

24. Update the program in exercise 14 to use functions. Following two function(s) need to be implemented:

minimum -- returns the minimum of the two input numbers

----------------------------------------------------------

25. Update the program in exercise 16 to use functions. Following two function(s) need to be implemented:

dist -- given two points coordinate pairs returns the distance between those two points

----------------------------------------------------------

26. Write a function that takes an integer as input and return 1 if th number is even, and 0 if it's odd.

----------------------------------------------------------

27. Write a C program that takes three inputs: temperature (in degrees Celsius), humidity (as a percentage), and wind speed (in km/h). Based on these inputs, the program should output one of the following weather forecasts:

Hint(s): You can use if-else statements and logical operators (&&, ||, !)

* **Sunny** if the temperature is above 20째C, humidity is below 60%, and wind speed is below 20 km/h.
* **Cloudy** if the temperature is between 10째C and 20째C, humidity is between 40% and 80%, and wind speed is below 30 km/h.
* **Rainy** if the temperature is below 10째C, humidity is above 80%, and wind speed is above 30 km/h.
* **Unknown** if none of the above conditions are met.

**Example Input/Output:**

* Input:
temperature = 25
humidity = 50
wind speed = 15

Output: Sunny

* Input:
temperature = 15
humidity = 70
wind speed = 25

Output: Cloudy

* Input:
temperature = 5
humidity = 90
wind speed = 40

Output: Rainy

----------------------------------------------------------

28. Create a program that takes two inputs: player 1's choice and player 2's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

* Use if conditions to determine the winner based on the game's rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
* Use a function to determine the winner and return a string indicating the result (e.g., "Player 1 wins!", "Player 2 wins!", or "Tie!").

* Input: 
Player 1's choice: r
Player 2's choice: s

Output: Player 1 wins!

Hint: You can use characters to take user's input. User can enter 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, and 's' for scissors.

----------------------------------------------------------

29a. Write a program to calculate and print the number of characters in a string. The string is given as input by the user (of max length: 64).

Hint(s): Include the "string.h" library, and use the strlen function. strlen takes a string as input and returns it's length. strlen is named after "String Length".

* Input: Hello World!

* Output: String length is 12

29b. Write a program to take a password from the user as input. If the password is correct, the print a welcome message for the user. If the password is incorrect, then print "Access denied."

The correct password is "exercise29b"

Hint(s):
	- The comparision operator == only works for basic data types in C such as short, int, float, double, and char. Since strings are technically a sequence of char, it is not a basic data type. Because of this, == operator will not work for strings.
	- Include the "string.h" library, and use the strcmp function to compare two strings. strcmp take two strings as input and returns 0 if both are equal. It returns a non-zero value if the input strings are different. Since 0 also means False in C, it can be used in a logical expression.

* Enter password: hellokitty
* Output: Access denied.

----------------------------------------------------------

30. Write a program that takes an interger for the day of the week and prints the name of the day. Use switch-case statements for this implementation. If the input is invalid, print "Invalid input.".

* Input: 1

* Output: Monday
