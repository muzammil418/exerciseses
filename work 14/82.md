## The Lost Signal of Planet Xylo

**Misson:**

You are a young communications officer aboard the starship *Aurora*. Your mission: to scan the galaxy for signs of life. Today, you’ve picked up a fragmented signal from Planet Xylo, a planet previously thought uninhabited. The signal is a series of numbers – seemingly random – but your captain believes it might be a distress code. 

The signal is too weak to fully decipher, but you’ve managed to capture a portion of it as an array of integers. Your task is to write a C program that can analyze this array and determine if *any* of the numbers are repeating. If a number repeats, it could indicate a crucial part of the distress signal is being re-sent due to damage! 

If there are repeating numbers, the program should output "Signal compromised!". Otherwise, it should output "Signal clear.".

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that takes an array of integers and its size as input, and determines if any of the numbers in the array are repeated.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int signal_array[10]; // Array to store the signal data
  int signal_size;       // Number of elements in the array

  // Get the size of the signal array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of signal readings: ");
  scanf("%d", &signal_size);

  // Get the signal readings from the user
  printf("Enter the signal readings:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < signal_size; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &signal_array[i]);
  }

  // Your code to check for repeating numbers goes here!
  
  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  printf("Signal clear.\n"); 

  return 0;
}
```

**Constraints**
- Size of signal array: 1 to 10
- Values of signal array: 1 to 10 (no other value is valid)
