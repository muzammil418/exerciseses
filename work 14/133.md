## The Xylo Artifact Scan

**Story:**

Following up on the fragmented signal, the *Aurora* has landed on Planet Xylo and discovered an ancient artifact. This artifact emits a sequence of energy pulses, represented as numbers. Your team believes these pulses contain a hidden activation code. 

However, the artifact is damaged, and some pulses are duplicated due to a malfunction. To unlock the artifact, you need to identify *how many* unique energy pulses are present in the sequence. Knowing the number of unique pulses is the first step to reconstructing the activation code.

Your task is to write a C program that takes an array of integers (representing the energy pulses) and its size as input. The program should count and output the number of *distinct* (unique) values in the array.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that counts the number of unique integers in an array.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int artifact_pulses[10]; // Array to store the energy pulse readings
  int pulse_count;          // Number of elements in the array

  // Get the size of the artifact pulse array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of artifact pulses: ");
  scanf("%d", &pulse_count);

  // Get the artifact pulse readings from the user
  printf("Enter the artifact pulse readings:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < pulse_count; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &artifact_pulses[i]);
  }

  // Your code to count the unique pulses goes here!
  int unique_count = 0;
  
  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  printf("Number of unique pulses: %d\n", unique_count);

  return 0;
}
```

Show a meaningful error and exit program for invalid values

**Constraints:**
Pulse count is the number of pulses that are stored inside the artifact_pulses array.
0 <= pulse_count < 10
