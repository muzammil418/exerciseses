## Project Starfall - Data Recovery

**The Story**

"You are Elara Vance, a junior data recovery specialist aboard the salvage vessel 'Stardust'. Your mission: retrieve vital sensor logs from the derelict research station 'Chronos', which mysteriously vanished near Kepler-186f decades ago. The Chronos station's primary memory core was damaged during its disappearance, but fragments of data were scattered across several backup files. These files are corrupted and require careful parsing to extract meaningful information.  Your task is to write a program that reads these fragmented log files, identifies lines containing specific keywords (like 'Anomaly Detected', 'Energy Spike', or 'Lifeform Signature'), and compiles them into a single, organized report."

**Exercise: Data Recovery Program**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define some keywords to search for (expand this list!)
const char *keywords[] = {"Anomaly Detected", "Energy Spike", "Lifeform Signature"};
int num_keywords = sizeof(keywords) / sizeof(keywords[0]);


int main() {
    char filename[100]; // To store the name of the input file.  Get this from user?
    FILE *inputFile;
    char line[256]; // Buffer to hold each line read from the file
    char reportFilename[100] = "starfall_report.txt"; // Name for the output report file

    // 1. Get filename from the user (or hardcode it for testing)
    printf("Enter the name of the Chronos log file: ");
    scanf("%s", filename);  // Be careful about buffer overflows! Consider fgets() if you want to be extra safe.

    // 2. Open the input file in read mode ("r")
    inputFile = fopen(filename, "r");

    if (inputFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        return 1; // Indicate an error occurred
    }


    // 3. Create/Open the report file in write mode ("w") - This will overwrite any existing file!
    FILE *reportFile = fopen(reportFilename, "w");

    if (reportFile == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening report file %s\n", reportFilename);
        fclose(inputFile); // Close the input file before exiting.  Important to prevent resource leaks!
        return 1;
    }


    // 4. Read the file line by line using fgets()
    //   - fgets reads a whole line from the file, including spaces.

    printf("Scanning log file...\n"); // Give user feedback

    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), inputFile) != NULL) {
        // 5. For each line, check if it contains any of the keywords.
        //   - Use string.h functions like strstr() to search for substrings within the line.
        //   - If a keyword is found, write the line to the report file.

        // Your code goes here
    }

    printf("Data recovery complete.\n");

    // 6. Close both files when you're done! This is *crucial*.
    fclose(inputFile);
    fclose(reportFile);

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
```

**Hints:**

*   **`string.h` Functions:**  Signature and information on 'strstr' function can be found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strstr.htm
*   **File I/O:** Review `fopen()`, `fgets()`, `fprintf()`, and `fclose()`.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Using `scanf("%s", filename)` can be dangerous if the user enters a very long filename, potentially causing a buffer overflow. `fgets()` is a safer alternative for getting input from the user. Check and verify the signature of `fgets()`. It takes the size of the input buffer/array as arguments, and will not overwrite beyond the given size.
*   **Report File:** The report file will contain all lines from the original files that matched at least one of the keywords.
*   **Debugging:** Use `printf()` statements strategically to print out variables and check if the code is behaving as expected -- if your program is not working as you expect. Using printf's can help trace and debug programs.

** Next steps:**

*   **Multiple Input Files:** Modify the program to accept multiple filenames from the user, processing each file individually.
*   **Case-Insensitive Search:** Implement a case-insensitive search for keywords (e.g., "anomaly detected" should match "Anomaly Detected").  This would involve converting both the line and the keyword to lowercase before comparison.
*   **Keyword Counts:** Add functionality to count how many times each keyword appears in the log files.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling, such as checking for invalid filenames or file access errors.
