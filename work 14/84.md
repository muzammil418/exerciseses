## The Xylo Flora Analysis

**Story:**

While exploring Planet Xylo, your team has discovered a variety of strange, bioluminescent flora. Each plant emits a unique light signature, which your scanner records as a numerical value. However, the scanner is prone to errors and sometimes records the same signature multiple times. 

To understand the biodiversity of Xylo, you need to analyze these readings. Specifically, you need to determine the *most frequent* light signature among all the readings. This will help identify the most common plant species.

Your task is to write a C program that takes an array of integers (representing the light signatures) and its size as input. The program should find and output the light signature that appears most often in the array. If there's a tie, output any one of the most frequent signatures.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that finds the most frequent integer in an array.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int flora_signatures[10]; // Array to store the light signature readings
  int signature_count;       // Number of elements in the array

  // Get the size of the flora signature array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of flora signatures: ");
  scanf("%d", &signature_count);

  // Get the flora signature readings from the user
  printf("Enter the flora signature readings:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < signature_count; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &flora_signatures[i]);
  }

  // Your code to find the most frequent signature goes here!
  int most_frequent = 0;
  
  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  printf("Most frequent signature: %d\n", most_frequent);

  return 0;
}
```
