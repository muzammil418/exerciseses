## The Xylo Guardian Protocol

**Story:**

Planet Xylo is protected by ancient robotic guardians, powered by complex energy cores. These guardians respond to a specific sequence of activation codes. Your team has intercepted a corrupted data stream containing potential activation codes, but it’s filled with errors and incomplete sequences.

The guardians require activation codes to be in a specific format: a sequence of numbers where each number is strictly greater than the previous one. Furthermore, the length of the valid code must be *at least* three numbers long. Your task is to analyze the intercepted data stream and identify the longest valid activation code sequence within it.

Your task is to write a C program that takes an array of integers (representing the potential activation codes) and its size as input. The program should find and output the length of the longest increasing subsequence within the array.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int activation_codes[10]; // Array to store the potential activation codes
  int code_count;          // Number of elements in the array

  // Get the size of the activation code array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of activation codes: ");
  scanf("%d", &code_count);

  // Get the activation code readings from the user
  printf("Enter the activation codes:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < code_count; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &activation_codes[i]);
  }

  // Your code to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence goes here!
  int longest_sequence_length = 0;

  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  printf("Length of the longest valid activation code sequence: %d\n", longest_sequence_length);

  return 0;
}
```
