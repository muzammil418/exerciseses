## 🧙‍♂️ Story: *The Wizard of Strings*

You are **Arin**, a young apprentice in the **Academy of Codecraft**.
Your mentor, **Professor Bitwise**, has given you a magical challenge:
to create your **own String Spells** — powerful functions that manipulate words and names without relying on ancient libraries like `<string.h>`.

To graduate from the academy, you must craft and test your spells carefully.

---

## 🎯 Your Mission

You must implement **five magical string functions** that behave like C’s built-in ones — but written entirely by you.

### 1. `my_strlen(char str[])`

> The *Length Spell*
> Count the number of characters in a string (until the `'\0'` null terminator).

**Example:**

```c
Input: "Magic"
Output: 5
```

---

### 2. `my_strcpy(char dest[], char src[])`

> The *Copy Charm*
> Copy all characters from `src` into `dest`.

**Example:**

```c
Input: src = "Wizard", dest = ""
Output: dest = "Wizard"
```

---

### 3. `my_strcat(char dest[], char src[])`

> The *Merge Incantation*
> Join two strings together — append `src` to the end of `dest`.

**Example:**

```c
Input: dest = "Code", src = "craft"
Output: "Codecraft"
```

---

### 4. `my_strcmp(char str1[], char str2[])`

> The *Comparator Hex*
> Compare two strings alphabetically:

* Return `0` if both are equal
* Return a **positive number** if `str1` > `str2`
* Return a **negative number** if `str1` < `str2`

**Example:**

```c
Input: str1 = "apple", str2 = "apricot"
Output: negative value (since 'l' < 'r')
```

---

### 5. `my_strrev(char str[])`

> The *Mirror Spell*
> Reverse a string in place.

**Example:**

```c
Input: "Potion"
Output: "noitoP"
```

---

## 🧪 Final Challenge — The Spell Test

Write a `main()` function that:

1. Asks the user for their **wizard name**
2. Prints the name’s length
3. Copies it into another string
4. Concatenates `" the Brave"` to it
5. Compares the original name and the modified one
6. Shows the reversed name as a secret code

**Example Output:**

```
Enter your wizard name: Arin
Your name has 4 letters.
Copy successful! Your title is: Arin the Brave
Comparing 'Arin' and 'Arin the Brave' gives: -32
Your secret code name is: nirA
```

## 💡 Tips for the Apprentice

* Don’t use `<string.h>` — you are learning to *create* magic, not borrow it.
* Use `for` and `while` loops carefully — they are your magic circles.
* Remember: every string ends with `'\0'`. Forgetting it breaks the spell!
