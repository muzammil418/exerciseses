## The Xylo Crystal Resonance

**Story:**

The *Aurora*’s science team has discovered a network of energy crystals on Planet Xylo. These crystals resonate at different frequencies, represented by numerical values. To map the crystal network, you need to analyze the resonance patterns.

A key aspect of the network is identifying “harmonic pairs” – two crystals that resonate at frequencies that add up to a specific target value. Your captain believes that finding these harmonic pairs will reveal the network’s structure.

Your task is to write a C program that takes an array of integers (representing the crystal resonance frequencies), its size, and a target sum as input. The program should count and output the number of pairs of distinct crystals in the array whose frequencies add up to the target sum.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that counts the number of pairs of distinct elements in an array that sum to a target value.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int crystal_frequencies[10]; // Array to store the crystal resonance frequencies
  int frequency_count;          // Number of elements in the array
  int target_sum;               // The target sum for harmonic pairs

  // Get the size of the crystal frequency array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of crystal frequencies: ");
  scanf("%d", &frequency_count);

  // Get the crystal frequency readings from the user
  printf("Enter the crystal frequencies:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < frequency_count; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &crystal_frequencies[i]);
  }

  // Get the target sum from the user
  printf("Enter the target sum: ");
  scanf("%d", &target_sum);

  // Your code to count the harmonic pairs goes here!
  int harmonic_pair_count = 0;

  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  printf("Number of harmonic pairs: %d\n", harmonic_pair_count);

  return 0;
}
```
