### Mission Briefing: The Cosmic Courier

**Mission:** You are a brave Cosmic Courier, piloting your trusty starship, the "Stardust Hopper." Your mission is to deliver vital supplies to a remote space station, Kepler-186f. However, a meteor shower has scattered your cargo across a dangerous asteroid field. You need to collect all the scattered supply pods before you can reach the station.

**The Challenge:** Your ship's scanner can detect up to 10 different locations in the asteroid field where cargo *might* be. Each location is represented by a number:

*   **0:** Nothing there.
*   **1:** A valuable supply pod!

You have a list of these scanner readings for 10 locations. Your task is to write a C program that helps you:

1.  **Scan the Asteroid Field:** Record the scanner readings for each of the 10 locations.
2.  **Identify Supply Pods:** Count how many supply pods you've found.
3.  **Calculate Cargo Weight** Each supply pod weighs 5 units. Calculate the total weight of the cargo you've collected.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to count the number of supply pods
int countSupplyPods(int readings[], int size) {
    // --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
}

// Function to calculate the total weight of the cargo
int calculateTotalWeight(int numberOfPods) {
	// --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
}

int main() {
    // Array to store scanner readings for 10 locations
    int asteroidReadings[10];
    int numberOfLocations = 10;

    printf("--- Cosmic Courier Mission: Asteroid Field Scan ---\n");
    printf("Scanning %d locations...\n", numberOfLocations);

    // --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
    // Use a loop to get scanner readings for each location.
    // You can either pre-define the readings for now, or ask the user to input them.
    // Example: For pre-defined readings:
    // int sampleReadings[] = {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1};
    // for (int i = 0; i < numberOfLocations; i++) {
    //     asteroidReadings[i] = sampleReadings[i];
    // }
    // Or to ask the user:
    // printf("Enter scanner reading for location %d (0 or 1): ", i + 1);
    // scanf("%d", &asteroidReadings[i]);
    // --- END YOUR CODE ---

    // Call the function to count supply pods
    int podsFound = countSupplyPods(asteroidReadings, numberOfLocations);

    printf("\n--- Mission Update ---\n");
    printf("Number of supply pods found: %d\n", podsFound);

    // Call the function to calculate total weight
    int cargoWeight = calculateTotalWeight(podsFound);
    printf("Total cargo weight: %d units\n", cargoWeight);

    // --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
    // Add a final message based on whether you found enough pods or not.
	// Write "Successfully collected cargo! Proceeding to Kepler-186f.\n"
	// OR "No cargo found. Returning to base for resupply.\n", if no pods are found
    // --- END YOUR CODE ---

    return 0;
}
```
