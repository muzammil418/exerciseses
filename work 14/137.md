## The Xylo Ecosystem Simulation

**Story:**

Planet Xylo’s ecosystem is incredibly delicate and interconnected. Your team is running simulations to predict the impact of introducing a new energy source. The simulation models the energy flow between different species, represented by numerical values indicating energy consumption and production.

The simulation generates a circular array representing the ecosystem. Each element in the array represents a species. A species receives energy from the species before it and provides energy to the species after it (the last species provides energy to the first, forming a circle).

The simulation is considered stable if, for every species, the energy it *receives* is greater than or equal to the energy it *provides*. Your task is to write a C program that determines if the Xylo ecosystem simulation is stable.

**Your Task:**

Write a C program that takes an array of integers (representing the energy balance of each species) and its size as input. The program should determine if the ecosystem is stable, meaning each species receives at least as much energy as it provides, considering the circular nature of the ecosystem. Output "Stable" if the ecosystem is stable, and "Unstable" otherwise.

**Scaffolding Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int ecosystem_energy[10]; // Array to store the energy balance of each species
  int species_count;          // Number of elements in the array

  // Get the size of the ecosystem energy array from the user
  printf("Enter the number of species: ");
  scanf("%d", &species_count);

  // Get the ecosystem energy readings from the user
  printf("Enter the energy balance for each species:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < species_count; i++) {
    scanf("%d", &ecosystem_energy[i]);
  }

  // Your code to determine if the ecosystem is stable goes here!
  int is_stable = 1; // Assume stable initially

  // Example output (replace with your logic)
  if (is_stable) {
    printf("Stable\n");
  } else {
    printf("Unstable\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```
