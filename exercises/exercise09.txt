Programming Challenge: 9

Dated: 24th of September, 2025
===========================
0. Read all the rules below.
1. The output on cmd must match the Expected Output exactly.
2. All programs must start with a comment of program description.
3. Write solution logic in comments before writing the program in comments.
4. Make variable and function names meaningful. In other words, a variable name should tell the name of the value it holds. Write code as if it's going to be read by another human. Example:
	- number of players -> num_players
	- sum of odd numbers -> sum_odds
	- counter -> count or counter
	- rectangle area -> rect_area or rectangle_area
5. Write properly formatted code.
6. Use of ChatGPT or Google's Gemini (in google search) is not allowed for formulas or logic of the program. To find syntax solutions or advice or reading material use: https://duckduckgo.com/
7.	a. For every function that is used from the C library (such as stdio, math, etc.) write it's signature (input/output usage in comments before use). For example, the signature of the 'pow' function is:
	double pow(double base, double exponent);
	b. For every function you implement, write it's input and output in the comments inside the function definition. For example:
	int add_one(int number){
		// Input: int number
		// Output: int
		
		return number+1;
	}
8. Write each program step by step and make sure to check each step before updating the code.
9. The final source code (C files) should be .


*** HINT: Use paper and pencil to understand and write the logic BEFORE starting with the code.

==========================================================

81. Least Frequent Integer

Write a C program that takes n number of positive integers. Find the integer that appears the least number of times among the said integers. If there are multiple such integers, select the smallest one.

Sample Date:
(1,2,3) -> 1
(10, 20, 4, 5, 11) -> 4

==========================================================

82. Reverse Substring

Write a C program that takes a string and two integers (n1, n2). Now reverse the sequence of characters in the string between n1 and n2.

Sample Date:
("abcdxyabcd", 5, 6) -> "abcdyxabcd"
("Exercises", 1, 3) -> "exercises"

==========================================================

83. Second Largest Among Three

Write a C program that accepts three integers from the user and finds the second largest number among them.

Constraints:

    1≤ x ≤100
    1≤ y ≤100
    1≤ z ≤100

Sample Date:

(1 , 2, 3) -> 2
(10, 12, 24) -> 12
(34, 21, 30) -> 30

==========================================================

84. Intersection of Two Sequences

Write a C program that accepts two sequences ((a1, a2, .. an), (b1, b2, .. bn)) of integers as input. Find all integers that appear in both sequences, one by one, in ascending order.

Constraints:

    1≤N1≤100, N1 -> number of integers in first sequence.
    1≤N2≤100, N2 -> number of integers in second sequence.
    1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N1 )
    1 ≤ bj ≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ j ≤ N2 )

Sample Date:

( 1 2 3 ) (1 2 3 4) -> 1 2 3
( 1 2 3 ) (1 2 3) -> 1 2 3
(1 2 3 4 5 6) -> 

==========================================================

85. Sum Before and After Maximum

Write a C program that accepts a sequence of different values and calculates the sum of the values before and after the maximum value.
The sum of the values before the maximum value is 0, if there are no values before the maximum. Similarly, the sum of the values after the maximum value is 0, if there are no values after the maximum.

Sample Date:

1 2 3 -> 3 0
1 2 9 4 5 -> 3 9
2 2 2 2 -> 0 6

==========================================================

86. Longest Ascending Contiguous Subsequence

Write a C program that accepts a sequence of positive integers from the user and finds the longest continuous subsequence.

Sample Date:

Length of the sequence: 5
Sequence: 5 2 3 4 1
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 3 [2 3 4]

Length of the sequence: 6
Sequence: 10 20 30 40 50 60
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 6 [10 20 30 40 50 60]

Length of the sequence: 3
Sequence: 5 1 3
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 2 [1 3]

==========================================================

87. Left Rotate Array

==========================================================

88. Reverse Array

Write a C program to reverse a given array of integers of length 5.
Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 
Elements in reverse array are: 50, 40, 30, 20, 10

==========================================================

89. Reverse Array
