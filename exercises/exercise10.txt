Programming Challenge: 10

Dated: 24th of September, 2025
===========================
0. Read all the rules below.
1. The output on cmd must match the Expected Output exactly.
2. All programs must start with a comment of program description.
3. Write solution logic in comments before writing the program in comments.
4. Make variable and function names meaningful. In other words, a variable name should tell the name of the value it holds. Write code as if it's going to be read by another human. Example:
	- number of players -> num_players
	- sum of odd numbers -> sum_odds
	- counter -> count or counter
	- rectangle area -> rect_area or rectangle_area
5. Write properly formatted code.
6. Use of ChatGPT or Google's Gemini (in google search) is not allowed for formulas or logic of the program. To find syntax solutions or advice or reading material use: https://duckduckgo.com/
7.	a. For every function that is used from the C library (such as stdio, math, etc.) write it's signature (input/output usage in comments before use). For example, the signature of the 'pow' function is:
	double pow(double base, double exponent);
	b. For every function you implement, write it's input and output in the comments inside the function definition. For example:
	int add_one(int number){
		// Input: int number
		// Output: int
		
		return number+1;
	}
8. Write each program step by step and make sure to check each step before updating the code.
9. The final source code (C files) should be .


*** HINT: Use paper and pencil to understand and write the logic BEFORE starting with the code.

91. New Array from First and Last Elements

Write a C program to create a new array taking the first and last elements of a given array of integers and length one or more.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 
Elements in new array are: 10, 50

==========================================================

92. Compare Sum of Two Arrays

Write a C program to compute the sum of the two given arrays of integers, length 3 and find the array that has the largest sum.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 10, 20, -30 
Elements in original array are: 10, 20, 30 
The array which has the largest sum.: 10, 20, 30

==========================================================

93. Extract Middle Elements from Even Array

Write a C program to create an array taking two middle elements from a given array of integers of length even.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 
New array: 7, 9

==========================================================

94. Merge Two Arrays of Length 3

Write a C program to create a new array from two given arrays of integers, each of length 3.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array1 are: 10, 20, 30 
Elements in original array2 are: 40, 50, 60 
New array: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60

==========================================================

95. Swap First and Last in Array

Write a C program to create a new array by swapping the first and last elements of a given array of integers whose length is at least 1.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array1 are: 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 
New array, after swapping first and last elements: 13, 5, 7, 9, 11, 1

==========================================================

96. Check for Adjacent 5's in Array

Write a C program to check whether a given array of integers contains 5 next to a 5 somewhere.

Expected Output:

[1,2,4] => 0
[1,5,5,1,3] => 1
[1,2,4,8,7,5,5,0] => 1

==========================================================

97. Shift Zeros to Left in Array

Write a C program to create a new array from a given array of integers shifting all zeros to left direction.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 1, 2, 0, 3, 5, 7, 0, 9, 11 
Elements in new array are: 0, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11


==========================================================

98. Partition Array: Evens Before Odds

Write a C program to create an array from a given array of integers shifting all even numbers before all odd numbers.

Expected Output:

Elements in original array are: 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 6, 9, 11 

Elements in new array are: 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 5, 9, 11


==========================================================

99. Print Unique Elements

Write a program in C to print all unique elements in an array.
Test Data :
Print all unique elements of an array:
------------------------------------------
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array: 4
Input 4 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 3
element - 1 : 2
element - 2 : 2
element - 3 : 5

Expected Output:
The unique elements found in the array are:
3 5


==========================================================

100. Sort Array Ascending

Write a program in C to sort elements of an array in ascending order.
Test Data :
Input the size of array : 5
Input 5 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 2
element - 1 : 7
element - 2 : 4
element - 3 : 5
element - 4 : 9

Expected Output:
Elements of array in sorted ascending order:
2 4 5 7 9
