/*
Take a binary number as input from the user and convert it to decimal. Maximum user input can be of length 8. User input must be a positive number.

(if needed) Use the strlen function from string.h library to verify the length.
Usage: strlen("Hello"); // returns 5 as result

Use the exit function from stdlib.h to exit the program if input conditions are not met.
Usage: exit(int); // exits the program when called
